Having had much success in her life thus far, receiving her degree in marketing to becoming a celebrity publicist and serial entrepreneur, Elayne Rivers has decided to spread her wings and give back to the community in a way that is personal and close to her heart. The organization has hopes of taking any money gained from fundraisers, grants, merchandise sales, and donations to not only travel around the country holding these workshops, but also to create content and programming in various media formats to convey such positive messages. A portion of the proceeds gained from fundraising efforts will go to the funeral and burial expenses of victims who have fallen prey to hate crimes.
